## Pattern to Follow

For each class and subject:
1. Extract unique chapter names from `script.js`
2. Remove " - Quiz 1", " - Quiz 2" suffixes
3. Split: First half → `midterm1`, Second half → `midterm2`
4. Create structure with 25 MCQs + 10 Fill-in-Blank + 10 True/False + 5 Assertion/Reasoning per chapter

## Next Steps

Continue restructuring remaining classes following the Class 1 pattern.
