// This script will help restructure midterm-questions.js
// Extract unique chapters from script.js and split them for midterm1 and midterm2

// This is a helper script - we'll use the logic to restructure the file
// For each class and subject in script.js:
// 1. Get all unique chapter titles
// 2. Remove " - Quiz 1", " - Quiz 2" suffixes
// 3. Split chapters: first half -> midterm1, second half -> midterm2
// 4. Create template structure with 25 MCQs + 10 Fill-in-Blank + 10 True/False + 5 Assertion/Reasoning
